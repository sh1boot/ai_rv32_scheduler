    Summary statistics produced by a single emit() call.

    Per-rule counters
    -----------------
    All three counters operate on strict non-overlapping pair slots
    (0,1), (2,3), … only — the actual pairs the hardware would see.
    First-match priority is used throughout so the numbers add up cleanly
    and the rule list order becomes an explicit experiment axis.

    rule_counts  : {rule_name: int}
        Pairs *won* by this rule — it was the first rule to match and the
        pair slot was successfully filled.  This is the definitive measure
        of a rule's contribution.

    rule_shadow  : {rule_name: int}
        Pairs where this rule matched but a *higher-priority* rule in the
        list also matched and won the slot.  A high shadow count means the
        rule is being crowded out; promoting it in the list would convert
        shadows into wins (at the cost of the shadowing rule's wins).

    rule_missed  : {rule_name: int}
        Pair slots where this rule matched *neither* instruction combination
        in the slot (i.e. pair_score was 0 for the slot as a whole), but the
        rule *did* fire on the same two instructions when tested independently.
        In practice this means the slot was a failed pair (neither instruction
        satisfied any rule as the winning instruction in that slot), yet this
        rule still saw a match — indicating the scheduler placed a matching
        pair into an already-lost slot.  A high missed count suggests the
        scheduler couldn't align this rule's matches to winnable slots, often
        due to dependency constraints.

    rvc_eligible : int
        Instructions in the final scheduled sequence satisfying can_compress().
        Reference ceiling: floor(rvc_eligible / 2) is the maximum achievable
        RVC pairs if every eligible instruction could be matched with another.

    singleton_tally : {(label_a, label_b): int}
        For every position i where instruction i ended up as a singleton and
        i+1 exists, record (label(i), label(i+1)).  This is exactly the (a, b)
        pair the scorer tested and rejected.  Sorted by count descending, this
        reveals which opcode combinations are most often adjacent but unpairable
        — the highest-count entries are the best candidates for new pairing rules.

        Labels are the instruction mnemonic, except that loads and stores with
        sp (x2) as their base register use the qualified form ``mnemonic(sp)``
        (e.g. ``lw(sp)``, ``sw(sp)``).  Stack-relative accesses are subject to
        different pairing constraints than heap/data accesses and benefit from
        being counted separately.

        Note: the last instruction in the sequence (no successor) contributes
        a (label, "") entry — i.e. it is counted as a singleton with an empty
        partner label, since there is no adjacent instruction to compare against.

    unpaired_opcode_tally : {label: int}
        Flat count of instructions that ended up unpaired, keyed by the same
        qualified label used in singleton_tally (``lw(sp)`` etc. for
        stack-relative accesses, plain mnemonic otherwise).  Useful for "which
        opcodes most often miss pairing" without worrying about the partner.

    Improve the pair score by renaming destination registers in two phases.

    *max_trials* caps the total number of rename candidates evaluated across
    both phases.  When the budget is exhausted the best schedule found so far
    is returned.  This bounds latency for large blocks where the rename search
    space is too large to explore fully.

    Phase 1 — Divergent rename (free-register targeting)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    For each instruction whose destination is renameable (dead after its last
    consumer), try renaming it to any free register (not live in the window)
    and keep the rename if ``count_pairs`` improves.

    Phase 2 — Convergent rename (pairing-targeted)
    -----------------------------------------------
    For each strict pair at positions (2k, 2k+1), if the pair currently scores
    zero, attempt renames that make the two instructions share registers or
    both land in the ABI temporary pool, then re-score.  Specifically:

      a) **Destination convergence**: if instruction A's destination is
         renameable and instruction B has a register (def or use) that A could
         be renamed to, try that rename.  This covers the sign-extend idiom:

             slli  t0, a0, 24       # intermediate dead, dest could be t1
             srai  t1, t0, 24       # t1 is the final value
           → rename slli dest to t1:
             slli  t1, a0, 24  # PAIR+
             srai  t1, t1, 24

      b) **Temporary convergence**: if both instructions in the pair write
         dead destinations, try renaming both into the ABI temporary set
         (``t0``–``t2`` = x5–x7, ``t3``–``t6`` = x28–x31) so downstream
         scoring functions that reward temporaries can fire.

    A register is *renameable* at position P when:
      - It is not architecturally reserved (x0, ra, sp, gp, tp).
      - It is not a vector register.
      - Its defined value is dead: either no later instruction in the block
        reads it before the next write, or it is only read by instructions
        that are within the rename window (the span from the def to its last
        consumer).

    Safety invariant: no rename is ever applied unless ``count_pairs``
    strictly increases, so correctness is preserved by construction.

        Return True when *name* must be treated as a scheduling barrier.

        A label is a barrier when:
          - It is a branch or jump target (any instruction can transfer
            control to it, so nothing may be reordered past it), OR
          - It is externally visible (declared .globl / .weak / etc.) — it

        ``.Lfunc_end*`` in ``.size`` expressions, ``.Lpcrel_hi*`` in
        ``%pcrel_lo()`` relocation operands) are NOT barriers: no
        instruction can branch to them, so the scheduler is free to move
        instructions across them.  Their text is still emitted as-is.

        Note: ``.Lpcrel_hi*`` labels appear between an ``auipc`` and the
        ``addi`` that consumes ``%pcrel_lo()``.  Reordering those two would
        corrupt the relocation, but the pair is already protected by a RAW
        dependency on the register ``auipc`` writes — so the label does not
        need to be a barrier itself.
